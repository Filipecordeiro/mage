#Assignment 4

During this assignement we went through the testing phase of our project. We carefully analysed the testing tools created
by the developers in order to understand how this is done. Finally, we corrected a bug in the project.

__Software Testability and Reviews__

When it comes to testing, XMage has several features that help developers with their contributions. Testing can be done in 2 ways. For starters, as we stated previously in other assignements, the entire project is a set of other projects. This means that each big component of the game has its own project. Testing is no exception to that, in a way that a testing project was created, filled with tons of tests. These tests cover the entirety of the project, although they focus more on the Mage logic than other parts. However, this particular testing project is very complex. It is very well structured in a way that anyone can look up tests regarding a certain topic very easily. The separation of the different components in testing is also a concern, as the tests are very independent. There are specific tests for very particular parts of the project, so everything can be tested. However, as much as the Mage Test project is useful, we are always bound to run into other errors that don't get reported by the coded tests. Because of this, Mage has its own unique testing tool which allows for developers to test the multiple components involved in the game all together. Contributors can run the game in testing mode, which basicly gives them total control over a lot of things game related, enhancing testing experience. This allows for someone who is developing something very specific (and therefore, hard to test) to easily test it, given the amount of control the testing tool gives them.

__Test Statistics__

__Bugs__

__Team Contribution__

Everyone worked together to test the project and identify bugs. We analysed testing providing statistics regarding coverage
and other aspects and ended our assignment fixing a bug.
