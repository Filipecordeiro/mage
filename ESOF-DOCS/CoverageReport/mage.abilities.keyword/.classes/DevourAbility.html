<i>35</i>&nbsp;/**
<i>36</i>&nbsp; * 502.82. Devour
<i>37</i>&nbsp; *
<i>38</i>&nbsp; * 502.82a Devour is a static ability. &quot;Devour N&quot; means &quot;As this object comes
<i>39</i>&nbsp; * into play, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This permanent comes
<i>40</i>&nbsp; * into play with N +1/+1 counters on it for each creature sacrificed this way.&quot;
<i>41</i>&nbsp; *
<i>42</i>&nbsp; * 502.82b Some objects have abilities that refer to the number of creatures the
<i>43</i>&nbsp; * permanent devoured. &quot;It devoured&quot; means &quot;sacrificed as a result of its devour
<i>44</i>&nbsp; * ability as it came into play.&quot;
<i>45</i>&nbsp; *
<i>46</i>&nbsp; * Devour appears only on creature cards.
<i>47</i>&nbsp; *
<i>48</i>&nbsp; * A creature with devour can devour other creatures no matter how it comes into
<i>49</i>&nbsp; * play.
<i>50</i>&nbsp; *
<i>51</i>&nbsp; * You may choose to not sacrifice any creatures.
<i>52</i>&nbsp; *
<i>53</i>&nbsp; * If you play a creature with devour as a spell, you choose how many and which
<i>54</i>&nbsp; * creatures to devour as part of the resolution of that spell. (It can&#39;t be
<i>55</i>&nbsp; * countered at this point.) The same is true of a spell or ability that lets
<i>56</i>&nbsp; * you put a creature with devour into play.
<i>57</i>&nbsp; *
<i>58</i>&nbsp; * You may sacrifice only creatures that are already in play. If a creature with
<i>59</i>&nbsp; * devour and another creature are coming into play under your control at the
<i>60</i>&nbsp; * same time, the creature with devour can&#39;t devour that other creature. The
<i>61</i>&nbsp; * creature with devour also can&#39;t devour itself.
<i>62</i>&nbsp; *
<i>63</i>&nbsp; * If multiple creatures with devour are coming into play under your control at
<i>64</i>&nbsp; * the same time, you may use each one&#39;s devour ability. A creature you already
<i>65</i>&nbsp; * control can be devoured by only one of them, however. (In other words, you
<i>66</i>&nbsp; * can&#39;t sacrifice the same creature to satisfy multiple devour abilities.) All
<i>67</i>&nbsp; * creatures devoured this way are sacrificed at the same time.
